## Border
Creates a new layer with a 1 pixel wide border around the current image for all frames.

## SpriteLamp
An older experiment of mine to autogenerate lighting profiles for use with [SpriteLamp](http://www.snakehillgames.com/spritelamp/)
Takes in a `YOURIMAGENAME_Diffuse` file and outputs Top, Bottom, Left, Right and Front lighting profiles based on the Diffuse image layers.
I stopped using this myself, so don't expect any bugfixes/updates.
